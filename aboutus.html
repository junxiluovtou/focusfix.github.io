    <h1>About us!</h1>
    <h2> Who are we? </h2>
    <p>We are Team Red. We have discovered that ADHD is a problem affecting middle school students. We have decided to work together in the Techgirls project, hoping that we can find a solution and help students in need with our app - FocusFix.io. <p>
    <h2>What is our goal?</h2>
    <p>ADHD is a problem that affects many middle school children. It affects people's ability to focus and manage time. Overall, it impacts student's academic performance. Our app is simple and very easy to use. It has many different features that combine different ideas that have been used to help students with ADHD. It has calming music to help drown out background noise, lists and reminders which remind the students of tasks they have to complete, a function that takes photos of any important instructions and a calendar which shows the students timetable and any important reminders they have to complete. Our app will help students with ADHD as it will keep them on task and improve their ability to focus and manage their time.</p>
    <h2>About our app</h2>
    <p>We are adapting learning to support middle and high school students  (10-15 years old) with diagnosed ADHD to stay on top of daily tasks and improve academic performance.

        We chose a younger audience as individuals with ADHD may struggle to communicate with peers and teachers in school, resulting in a decline in academic performance. As expectations and responsibilities increase during high school, the harder it gets for students with ADHD to keep on top of tasks. The app aims to create an organised virtual space of student's tasks that includes; focus tunes, reminders, learning methods, timetables etc.</p>
